# Attendance Management

This repository contains the frontend code for the Attendance Tracker application. The Attendance Tracker is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate attendance management for educational institutions, organizations, or any other entity that requires attendance tracking.

The frontend code is developed using modern web technologies such as React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Attendance Tracker system.

## Features

The frontend code offers the following features:

- User authentication and authorization: The application supports user registration, login, and logout functionality. It ensures that only authorized users can access and modify attendance records.

- Dashboard: The dashboard provides an overview of attendance statistics, including attendance summaries, charts, and graphs.

- Attendance management: Users can create, update, and delete attendance records. They can mark attendance for individual students, view attendance history, and generate reports.

- Student management: Users can manage student records, including adding new students, updating existing information, and deleting records when necessary.

- Class management: The application supports the creation and management of classes. Users can create new classes, assign students to classes, and view class-specific attendance information.

- Notifications: The system can send automated notifications to users regarding attendance-related events, such as upcoming classes or missing attendance.

## Getting Started

To run the frontend code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kushagra-singhh/Attd-Frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Attd-Frontend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

5. Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible at the specified URL. The frontend code expects the backend API to be available at `http://localhost:8000` by default. If your backend server is running on a different URL, update the API URL in the code accordingly.

## Deployment

To deploy the frontend code to a production environment, you can use various hosting services such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. Follow the hosting provider's documentation to deploy the React application.

Remember to update the API URL in the code to point to the production backend server.
